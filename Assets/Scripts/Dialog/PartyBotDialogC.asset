  - question: "But anyways. HostBot gave this party it all, but I feel he gets over
      enthusiastic sometimes. Like, this room is pretty small and they invited a
      lot of bots. Don\u2019t you feel like its a bit overcrowded?"
    questionClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: 60fa0038097d5d94688121a367deb3ce, type: 3}
    answerA: I KNOW RIGHT? Like I get that you want lots of people to fill the room
      and get that party vibe going but come on..

  - question: "The decorations are pretty nice though at least.. Can\u2019t say the
      same about the food though.. Blegh.. But regardless everyone seems to be having
      a good time and enjoying themselves so its a success nonetheless, even if I\u2019m
      being picky. Entertainment is also pretty good, they even got a console running
      the latest Super Smash Fighters Z Ultra! Have you ever played that game?"
